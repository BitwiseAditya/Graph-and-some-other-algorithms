Differences between Bellman-Ford and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms:

Approach:
Bellman-Ford: Dynamic Programming approach.
Dijkstra: Greedy approach.

Negative Weights:
Bellman-Ford handles negative weight edges and detects negative weight cycles.
Dijkstra may not work with negative weight edges and definitely fails with negative weight cycles.

Result:
Bellman-Ford result contains vertices with information about other connected vertices.
Dijkstra result contains vertices with whole network information, not just connected vertices.

Complexity:
Bellman-Ford is more time-consuming (O(VE)).
Dijkstra is less time-consuming (O(E log V)).

Remember that Bellman-Ford is useful for graphs with negative weights, while Dijkstra is more efficient for non-negative weights.
